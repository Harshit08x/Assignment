    "# Question 1. Explain what inheritance is in object-oriented programming and why it is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that\n",
    "allows one class to inherit the properties and behaviors (i.e., fields and methods)\n",
    "of another class. It enables the creation of a new class (called a subclass or derived class)\n",
    "based on an existing class (called a base class or parent class)\n",
    "\n",
    "#Uses of inheritance :-\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Reusability: Inheritance promotes code reuse by allowing us to define common\n",
    " functionality in a base class and reuse it across multiple subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchy and Abstraction: Inheritance models real-world relationships and hierarchies. \n",
    "It helps organize classes into meaningful categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Inheritance enables polymorphism, where objects of different classes can be\n",
    "treated uniformly through a common interface (e.g., calling the same method on different\n",
    "subclasses).\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficiency: By inheriting from a base class, we avoid duplicating code and maintain a more\n",
    "efficient codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "#Example\n",
    "\n",
    "class Vehicle:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model):\n",
    "        self.make = make\n",

    "Question 2. Discuss the concept of single inheritance and multiple inheritance, highlighting their \n",
    "differences and advantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer - 1.Single Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Single inheritance refers to the scenario where a subclass (or derived class) inherits \n",
    "from only one base class (or parent class).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplicity:\n",
    "Single inheritance simplifies the class hierarchy, making it easier to understand and \n",
    "maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clear Relationships: \n",
    "Each subclass has a clear parent, and the relationship is straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Tight Coupling:\n",
    "A major disadvantage is tight coupling between the parent and child class.\n",
    "Changes in the parent class can ripple through to child classes, even if unintended. \n",
    "This can make maintaining and debugging code more complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limited Flexibility:  \n",
    "Since a child class inherits everything from the parent, it can be inflexible. \n",
    "The child class might inherit functionalities it doesn't need, or changes made to the \n",
    "parent might not be reflected in the desired way in the child \n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "#Example of single inheritance \n",
    "\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "  def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "    self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "  def make_sound(self):\n",
    "    print(\"Generic animal sound\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "  def __init__(self, name, breed):\n",
    "    super().__init__(name)  # Call the parent class constructor\n",
    "    self.breed = breed\n",
    "\n",
    "  def make_sound(self):\n",
    "    print(\"Woof!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create an Animal object (not very useful on its own)\n",
    "animal = Animal(\"Generic Animal\")\n",
    "animal.make_sound()  # Output: Generic animal sound\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a Dog object, inheriting from Animal\n",
    "dog = Dog(\"ALEX\", \"Labrador\")\n",
    "dog.make_sound()  # Output: Woof!\n",
    "\n",
    "# Dog also inherits the name property from Animal\n",
    "print(dog.name)  # Output: ALEX\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "2.Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Multiple inheritance occurs when a subclass inherits from two or more base \n",
    "classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Reusability: Multiple inheritance allows combining features from different sources \n",
    "(base classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "Richer Functionality: Subclasses can inherit diverse behaviors from various parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modeling Complex Relationships: Useful for modeling real-world scenarios \n",
    "(e.g., a FlyingCar inheriting from both Car and Aircraft).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Disadvantage:\n",
    "\n",
    "Diamond Problem: When two base classes share a common ancestor, and a subclass inherits \n",
    "from both, ambiguity arises. Which method should the subclass use?\n",
    "\n",
    "Method Resolution Order (MRO): Determining the order in which methods are called becomes \n",
    "crucial.\n",
