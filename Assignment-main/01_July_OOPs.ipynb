    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "An object is a fundamental concept that represents a real-world entity or a data structure.\n",
    "Almost everything in Python is an object, and understanding objects is essential for effective programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s explore what objects are and how they work:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.What is an Object?\n",
    "\n",
    "An object is an instance of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class serves as a blueprint or template for creating objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects encapsulate both data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on that data.\n",

    "In Python, objects represent real-world entities, such as people, cars, files,\n",
    "or even abstract concepts like numbers and strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Key Points about Objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "Identity: Each object has a unique identity (address in memory).\n",
    "\n",
    "Type: Objects belong to a specific type (class).\n",
    "\n",
    "Value: Objects store data (values) associated with their attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods: Objects can perform actions through their methods.\n",
