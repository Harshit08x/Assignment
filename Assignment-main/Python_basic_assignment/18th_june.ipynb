    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python logging, log formatters determine the layout and structure of your \n",

    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Capturing log messages from multiple modules or classes in a Python \n",
    "application involves a two-step process:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1.Configuring Loggers: You need to define a logging hierarchy using \n",
    "  loggers from the logging module. This hierarchy establishes how messages \n",
    "  from different parts of your application will be collected and propagated.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2.Using Loggers in Your Code: Once you have a configured logging hierarchy\n",
    "  you import the appropriate logger objects into your modules or classes and \n",
    "  use them to log messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Configuring Loggers:\n",
    "\n",
    "     Using basicConfig():\n",
    "\n",
    "       This is a simple way to set up basic logging. You can specify the log \n",
    "       level, formatter, and output handler (e.g., console, file) using the \n",
    "       arguments of basicConfig(). However, this approach creates a single \n",
    "       root logger, which might not be ideal for complex applications with \n",
    "       many modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Creating a Logging Hierarchy:\n",
    "\n",
    "      For better organization, you can create a hierarchy of loggers using \n",
    "      the getLogger() function. Each module or class can have its own logger \n",
    "      object, and you can define parent-child relationships between loggers. \n",
    "      Messages logged from a child logger will propagate up the hierarchy to \n",
    "      the parent logger(s) and eventually be handled by the configured \n",
    "      handlers.\n",
    "\n",
    "EXAMPLE: \n",
    "import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "# Configure a root logger with a basic console handler and INFO level\n",

    "\n",
    "    Production-Ready: print statements are primarily meant for development and debugging. In a\n",
